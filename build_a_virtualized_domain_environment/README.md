# Build a Virtualized Domain Environment

## Objective
This project is based on a real-world deployment I carried out for a community-focused organization in Oslo, Norway. The goal was to design a fully virtualized Windows Server environment simulating a corporate IT infrastructure.

It includes a Windows Server domain controller with Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP roles, plus a domain-joined Windows 11 client. The environment was built for internal IT training, testing user authentication, and learning domain management workflows.
## Tools Used
Virtualization: VMware Workstation / Oracle VirtualBox

OS: Windows Server 2019/2022 + Windows 11 ISO

Roles/Features:

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

DNS

DHCP

Networking: Host-Only / Internal-Only Virtual Network
